# Xian-Wu-Shopify-Challenge
Created with CodeSandbox

This is Xian Wu's (xianwu.iris@gmail.com) project for Shopify Front End Intern challenge.
The code is deployed at https://codesandbox.io/s/github/Xian-Wu2021/Xian-Wu-Shopify-Challenge/

I put my API keys in the .env. I don't usually do this, but for this project I am putting it on GitHub just to make sure the deployed app on CodeSandbox can work properly.

I completed two extra points:

(1) Let the user choose the AI engine from a select box.
There is a "Choose Engine" <select> and users could choose one engine of the four. The engine infomation would also be showed in the "Responses". Add some presets for the user to quickly send a good prompt.

(2) I added three preset messages.
When users click "preset 1" or "preset 2" or "preset 3", the corresponding message would be added to the prompt and also send to OpenAI.
